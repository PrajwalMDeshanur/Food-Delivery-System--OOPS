# Food Service System

## Project Overview
A C++ project demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The system allows customers to create accounts, select restaurants, and place orders, using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path for delivery.

## Key Features
- **Account Management**: Create customer accounts with encrypted passwords using Shift Cipher.
- **Order Processing**: Place orders with restaurants and store details in files.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest route between customer and restaurant.

## Concepts Used

### OOP Concepts
- **Classes & Objects**: Separate classes for customers, orders, and restaurants.
- **Inheritance & Encapsulation**: Inheritance for shared attributes and methods; encapsulation for data security.
- **Polymorphism**: Overloaded functions and methods for various operations.

### DSA Concepts
- **Graphs**: Locations represented as nodes, paths as edges.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path for delivery.
- **File Handling**: Persistent storage of customer data and order history.

## File Descriptions
- **`FoodServiceSys.cpp`**: Main code file with implementation of the system.
- **`graph.txt`**: Graph data for locations and distances.
- **`James.txt`, `Jay.txt`**: Customer account details.
- **`James_order.txt`, `Jay_order.txt`**: Order histories.

## How to Run
1. Compile `FoodServiceSys.cpp` using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow prompts to create accounts, place orders, and find the shortest route.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance password security.
- Add more restaurants and dynamic menu options.
- Integrate real-time order tracking.
